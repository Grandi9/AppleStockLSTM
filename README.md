Predicting AAPL stock price using LSTM

## Introduction
This program uses Recurrent neural network called - LSTM
I am using LSTM since it has Long term price dependencies
LSTM's are useful since we can give relavant weights to the important data in the past
We use this LSTM to predict the stock price of AAPL (Apple Inc) 
I am using the past 60 days stock price.
